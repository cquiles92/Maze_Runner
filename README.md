This project is a CLI maze generator. This program can be given a list of dimensions (height x length) or (height alone) and generate a random maze based off the dimensions. The program is able to save and load the maze to a specified filename that you enter in the command line. The program can also solve the maze and provide a solution to it using an implementation of the DFS algorithm (Depth First Search). The maze is generated randomly through a recursive implementation using a stack to branch through each node and create a maze that connects each internal cell (vector). In the future it may implement other maze generating algorithms such as Prim's or Kruskal's.
